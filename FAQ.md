## Program FAQs
### How to apply to the program?
You can apply to the Master's Program in Computer Science by visiting the website of NKU's graduate school (https://www.nku.edu/admissions/graduate.html), which contains all the information about the admission process (https://www.nku.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-process.html).

### What are the admission requirements for the MSCS program?
In addition to the requirements of NKU's graduate school, prospective students are required to hold a bachelor's degree with a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Students with a GPA between 2.6 and 3.0 may be considered with additional evidence of potential success.

### How long does it typically take to complete the MSCS program?
The MSCS curriculum can be completed within one year, provided that you take four courses in the Fall, four in the Spring, and two in the Summer. Although this is  is totally doable, it is not necessarily what many graduate students prefer, due to their other professional and personal commitments, including full- or part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and other circumstances.

Feel free to work with the program director to define a roadmap that aligns with your goals.

### Is the MSCS program offered entirely online, or are there in-person components?
The primary mode of instruction is in-person. However, several courses are also offered in an asynchronous online modality for additional flexibility.

### When are face-to-face courses taught?
All core face-to-face courses are night classes. Some electives taught in person might be offered as day classes.

### What kind of academic background do I need to be successful in the MSCS program?
The program accommodates students with diverse academic credentials beyond computer science, providing necessary knowledge to bridge gaps. If you don't have enough experience in Computer Science, especially regarding software development, object-oriented programming, and data structures, you can take one of the bridge courses listed below, which are especially designed to fill knowledge gaps.

- CSC 500 Programming Fundamentals or  
- a combination of the following:
  - CSC 260 Object-oriented programming I
  - CSC 360  Object-oriented programming II
  - CSC 364 Data structures and algorithms

### What are some examples of elective courses offered in the MSCS program?
Any CSC, MCY, and MBI course at the 500 or 600 level that is not counted as a Bridge, Core, or Experiential Learning course. Examples include the following:
- CSC 585 Theory of Computation
- MCY 620 Data privacy
- MCY 650 Ethical hacking
- MBI 650 Blockchain for business
- MBI 664 Data visualization and analytics

### Is an internship or co-op experience required as part of the MSCS curriculum?
Yes, CSC 696 â€“ Computer Science Co-op/Internship (3 credit hours) is required as part of the curriculum. This is designed for students who want to connect with local companies, and gain professional experience.

Students who already have professional experience commensurate with the requirements of the program can request the program director to get this course waived.

### Can I transfer credits from another institution towards the MSCS degree?
Students may transfer up to nine semester hours of appropriate, acceptable graduate coursework from other regionally accredited institutions.

### What career opportunities are available for graduates of the MSCS program?
Graduates may pursue roles in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and various other computer science fields.

### Are there any scholarships or financial aid options available for MSCS students?
Unfortunately, NKU does not offer graduate scholarship. However, for more comprehensive information about scholarships and financial aid, please contact the financial aid office for more information.
