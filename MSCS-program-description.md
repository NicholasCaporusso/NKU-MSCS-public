## Introduction 

The Master of Computer Science (MSCS) program provides a solid and comprehensive foundation in computing, with a strong emphasis on practical applications and skills relevant to current industry demands. Students explore contemporary and emerging domains and gain hands-on software development experience in areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. 

The MSCS program is designed for current computer science students and professionals, including career changers, seeking to deepen their expertise, strengthen their qualifications, advance their careers, or transition into the field. To this end, it accommodates students with diverse academic credentials beyond computer science, providing them with the necessary knowledge to bridge any gaps. Simultaneously, core courses and electives provide an in-depth coverage of key computer science fields. 

The MSCS curriculum can be completed within just one year, offering an accessible, comprehensive, and expedited path for several computer science roles and positions. The primary mode of instruction is in-person, augmented by a selection of online courses for added flexibility. The applied instructional approach fosters active engagement, peer collaboration, direct faculty interaction, and hands-on learning experiences. 

The MSCS program is administered by the School of Computing and Analytics, located in GH 400. For additional information, visit nku.edu/academics/informatics/programs/graduate/mscs.html or contact Dr. Nicholas Caporusso, MSCS director, at (859) 572-7632 or caporusson1@nku.edu. 

## Admission 

Students must have a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution with a GPA of 3.0 or higher among all undergraduate coursework. Students with a bachelor’s degree who have a GPA below 3.0 but above 2.6 should contact the MSCS Program Director to be considered for regular admission. You will be asked to submit additional evidence of your potential for being successful in the MSCS program that is judged satisfactory by the MSCS Admission Committee. Such evidence may include a previous graduate degree from a regionally accredited institution, graduate work at a regionally accredited institution with a GPA of 3.0 or above, work experience in a computer science field, GRE or GMAT scores, up to two letters of recommendation, and/or professional certifications. 

Admitted students who do not have an adequate computer science background will be required to complete CSC 500 Programming fundamentals (3 credits) or some combination of CSC 260 Object-Oriented Programming I, CSC 360 Object-Oriented Programming II and CSC 364 Data Structure and Algorithms. The decision of which course(s) to take will be made upon consultation and assessment with the Program Director. 

## Academic requirements

To earn a Master of Science in Computer Science, students are required to complete a minimum of 30 graduate credits (33 for those lacking the necessary programming background, determined at admission). 

These credits are structured as follows: 

- 21 credits in core courses. 
- 6 credits in elective courses. 
- 3 credits in experiential learning. 

### 0-3 Bridge courses (0 – 9 credit hours) 

- CSC500 Programming fundamentals **OR** some combination of CSC 260 Object-Oriented Programming I, CSC 360 Object-Oriented Programming II, and CSC 364 Data Structure and Algorithms 

Only required for admitted students with insufficient programming background. 

### 7 Core courses (21 credit hours)

- CSC 601 Advanced Programming 
- CSC 625 Applied Artificial Intelligence 
- CSC 640 Quality Software 
- CSC 650 SQL and NoSQL Databases 
- CSC 560 Operating Systems **OR** MCY 611 Cloud Computing 
- MCY 601-Cybersecurity Fundamentals **OR** MCY 602 - Network Security 
- MBI 650 - IT Project Management 

### 2 Elective courses (6 credit hours) 

- Any CSC, MCY, and MBI course at 500-level or 600-level that is not counted as Bridge, Core, or Experiential Learning courses. 

No more than three combined hours of independent study courses (599 and 699 courses) may be counted toward the degree. CSC 500 and experiential learning courses (596 and 696) will not count toward electives. 

### 1 Experiential learning experience (3 credit hours) 

- CSC 696 – Computer Science Co-op/Internship 

These credits can be taken across multiple semesters. 

### Transfer Credit 

Students may transfer up to nine semester hours of appropriate, acceptable graduate coursework from other regionally accredited institutions.
